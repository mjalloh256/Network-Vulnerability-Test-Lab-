## Preperation:  <br/>



<br /> The initial step I took when conducting the risk management framework on the network I was testing was preparation. In this scenario, I asked myself questions such as: What is my risk assessment target? Who and what am I assessing? How secure do I believe my network is before initiating an assessment? How many devices are connected to this network, and what are these devices used for? Who are the stakeholders in this scenario? What are the overall risks and potential security measures that may need to be implemented on this network? 

The risk management assessment was conducted on my home network. During the preparation phase, I concluded that the scope of my network's security was relatively unknown because no risk assessments had been done prior to this. The next step involved confirming the number of devices running on my network using an NMAP scan, revealing a total of 6 devices. To simplify my assessment, I excluded devices that showed no vulnerabilities. The stakeholders for this assessment include the people who use this network, which encompasses my family and me. My prediction for the overall security of the network was that it was secure.



<br />



 ## Categorize:  <br/> 

<br /> When categorizing the security of the network, questions arise, such as: What is the worst that can happen on the network? How could the stakeholders be affected by a breach in the network? What is the confidentiality of the data on that network?

I categorize the network's security using the CIA triad, focusing on the implementation of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The Confidentiality of the network's security is labeled as high because it is a private network containing a substantial amount of personal and private data on each device. The Integrity level of the network is labeled as low since it's a private network, reducing the likelihood of data tampering or changes. The Availability level of this network is labeled as moderate. It is not a public web server, so there is a moderate need for availability. It serves as a small private network connection used on a day-to-day basis for simple IoT device functions.

Another method to categorize the risk for the network's security is using a risk assessment matrix. This involves calculating the likelihood of a security issue happening and the severity/damage it can cause. Multiplying these factors provides the risk score.

While using the "Risk Assessment Matrix" I was able to give an assessment of the  probability of my network being compromised. With this "Risk Assessment Matrix I receviced a score of 3 on the Medium scale.
How this score was constructed was due to two factors. The probability of my network becoming compromised, and the type of damage it would cause if my netowork was compromised. For the probability of my network being compromised I gave it a rating of 1 and improbable. This is due to the fact that this is a personal private network. If it was to be compromised it most likly would of been a more targeted attack which lowers the probablity of it happening even more. The rating I gave for the amount of damage that could happen if this network was compromised would be a 3 which is "critical" on the "Risk Assesment Matrix". I labeled it as so due to the fact that if the network happened to become compromised it would be most likly a targeted attack with specfic goals and intentions hence labeling it as critical. 
<br />



## Select:  <br/>

<br /> During the selection phase, we carefully examine our safeguards and choose NIST controls for implementation in the assessment. In this instance, I referenced NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5. The selected control is Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning (RA-5). This control ensures that we:

Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications with a frequency and/or randomly defined by the organization, and in accordance with an organization-defined process.
Identify and report new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system.
Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process using standards for enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations, formatting checklists and test procedures, and measuring vulnerability impact.
Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring.
Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities within organization-defined response times based on an organizational assessment of risk.
Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with organization-defined personnel or roles to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems.
Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned. 




## Implemention 
<br/> The implementation phase of the risk assessment involves taking the selected controls/safeguards and ensuring their correct implementation. In this phase, it is crucial to assign a responsible person for each control to guarantee that all selected controls are effectively put in place. For instance, someone would be designated to oversee the RA-5 control from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5. This approach ensures that there is dedicated attention to each control, including its proper implementation and management.

1.Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported

2. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
  
3. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations
   
4.  Formatting checklists and test procedures

5. Measuring vulnerability impact

6. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring
   
7. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities Assignment: organization-defined response times in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk
   
8. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems
   
9. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.

This stage involves assigning and documenting all roles and responsibilities. Additionally, it includes documenting any new software or equipment that might be required to initiate the implementation of these new controls. In a real-life company environment, there may even be considerations for potential staffing changes as a result of this assessment. 


## Assess: 

<b> The Assessment phase is where we've initiated the implementation of our controls for the assessment. In this phase, we analyze and monitor how the implemented controls are functioning within the assessed subject. For instance, I could perform another network scan using Nessus to check for the same vulnerabilities or new ones, ensuring the security of the devices on that network. Additionally, I might run vulnerability scans on different tools like Armitage or Metasploit to assess if similar vulnerabilities and exploits are detected.

During this stage, assessors conducting the assessment phase of the risk management framework would thoroughly review all documentation related to the vulnerability scans conducted on the network. This information is crucial to ensuring proper assessment stages. Automation is particularly advised in this phase due to the exhaustive efforts required for monitoring and reporting on systems. <b> </br> 

## Authorize 

<b> 
For the authorization stage of this assessment, this is where a senior level advisor gets invovled. A senior level adviosr would then do an evaluation of the assessed subject.  In this scenario this is  the security of the network that was tested. After completion of the evaluatoion by the senior offical. If all controls that are set are deemed applicable and approved by the senior offical then it will then be sigined off and athorized. This is all completed by the senior offical by revewing the SAP(System Authorization Package) which includes the SSP (System Security Plan) and the SAR (Security Assesment Report). 


## Monitor 

<b>
The final step of the security risk assessment is to continue monitoring the implemented controls on the network for security. This can involve various activities, from installing updates on devices, especially security updates and patches, to replacing hardware that may be needed when its lifespan has run its course. Overall insuring that the security posture of that enviornmenet stays the same.   </b>

<br />       

In this window, you can observe the vulnerabilities listed for Microsoft Office applications. Multiple security issues render these Microsoft Office applications susceptible to attacks, such as remote code execution on Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Outlook. Additional vulnerabilities include Microsoft Excel security bypass, Microsoft Word elevation privilege vulnerability, and Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability. Upon reviewing each listed vulnerability, I concluded that the Microsoft Office applications should be updated to their respective latest versions, each containing security patches for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. After making this discovery, I downloaded the updated versions for each application.

<br />

<img src="https://imgur.com/KGSLIKJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

<br /> The vulnerability displayed in this window pertains to the Apache web server installed on macOS. In the first window, all possible vulnerabilities are listed. To remedy this, I downloaded an updated version of the Apache web server via the terminal, as shown in the second window. After installing the latest version, I used the httpd -v command to check the currently running version on macOS, which still showed the old version, 2.4.56. Subsequently, I restarted the Mac system for the updated web server to take effect. Upon rechecking, it displayed the most up-to-date version, Apache 2.4.58, which is the recommended version from Nessus containing the security patches for these vulnerabilities. 



<br />

<br /> 
The specific vulnerabilities listed for macOS pose potential threats that could be executed against the system. To remediate these vulnerabilities, a simple system update is recommended. The current version of macOS running on the system is 14.0. The update suggested by Nessus is macOS 14.1.2, which includes security patches for the vulnerabilities listed for version 14.0. I subsequently installed the latest macOS version on the system.

<br />

<img src="https://imgur.com/IgPLdqf.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>



<br /> The last vulnerability found on the macOS was associated with the Zoom application. The vulnerabilities identified by Nessus include improper authorization in some Zoom clients, which may allow an authorized user to conduct an escalation of privilege via network access. Additionally, insufficient control flow management in certain Zoom clients may permit an authenticated user to conduct information disclosure via network access. Other vulnerabilities comprise buffer overflow in specific Zoom clients, enabling an unauthenticated user to conduct a denial of service via network access. Furthermore, improper conditions check in Zoom Team Chat for Zoom clients may allow an authenticated user to conduct a denial of service via network access, and cryptographic issues with In-Meeting Chat for Zoom clients may allow a privileged user to conduct information disclosure via network access. These vulnerabilities are present in the current version of Zoom on this system, which is 5.15.12. Nessus recommends downloading version 15.16.0, which contains the vulnerability patches for this application. After discovering these vulnerabilities on the macOS system, I downloaded the latest version of the Zoom client application. 

<br />



## CIA TRIAD FRAMEWORK  :  <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/DIfJXge.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

<br /> The vulnerability assessment conducted on my network is a crucial task that companies worldwide must implement to ensure the security of their information/data. Cybersecurity frameworks, such as the CIA Triad, assist in ensuring proper security measures. In line with this framework, the vulnerability assessment I performed on my network prioritized the implementation of confidentiality. Safeguarding data confidentiality is paramount, and through the assessment, I identified vulnerabilities in certain applications that leaked data.

Integrity is the next objective in the CIA Triad. It is vital to ensure that information provided by applications maintains correct security measures, preventing tampering and ensuring 100 percent authenticity and trustworthiness. Vulnerabilities affecting integrity were also identified in my network.

The final objective covered by the CIA Triad in the network vulnerability assessment is availability. The vulnerability report provided by Nessus indicated that some applications had vulnerabilities susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In conclusion, the CIA Triad was effectively implemented in all these applications through the installation of updates for each API. The security vulnerabilities for these applications were mitigated, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability for each API on the device.

<h2>NIST INCIDENT CYCLE</h2>



 

 - <b> PREPERATION: In preparation for this lab, I had to download and configure the vulnerability scanning tool Nessus. After doing so, I confirmed what my test network would be, which ended up being my personal home network. I also identified specific targets that I expected to pose potential security issues due to a lack of updates. I made sure to list them and confirmed that they appeared in my Nessus vulnerability scan. </b>

  

- <b> DETECTION/ANALYSIS: The detection portion of this lab was entirely done through Nessus. Once I obtained the IP address of one of the devices on my home network, I specified the range I wanted to scan. This range scanned all IP addresses for possible devices connected to my network. After completing the network scan, the Nessus report provided vulnerabilities that needed remediation to ensure the overall safety of my devices. </b>



- <b> CONTAINMENT ERADECATION AND RECORVERY: The steps taken for containment, eradication, and recovery depend on organizational methods and policies. Generally, for a network vulnerability test, the priority would be addressing the vulnerabilities identified in your report. Prioritizing critical vulnerabilities first and working down to high, medium, and then low. After determining the vulnerabilities on your devices, you would want to install updates for each API or on your system, depending on the report Nessus has provided. </b>

- <b> POST INCIDENT ACTIVITY: In this example scenario, we were tasked with scanning a network and testing it for vulnerabilities. After receiving the vulnerability report from the test, we implemented remediation techniques to resolve these vulnerabilities, such as installing updates containing the most up-to-date security patches for these APIs. An example of post-incident activity that would likely take place after such a test would be analyzing a company's policy for device security. Depending on the vulnerabilities found and the time it took to remediate them, a company could adjust its policies. This could include changes to the type and frequency of network scans, the necessity for individual scans on devices, and various other suggestions based on the results of the scan. Overall, post-incident activity is a way to learn and reflect to ensure better protective security measures for the company. </b>
