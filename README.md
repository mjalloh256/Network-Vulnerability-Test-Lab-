## Preperation:  <br/>



<br /> The first step I took when conducting the risk managment framework on the network I was testing was preperation. During this scenario you ask yourself questions like what is my risk assessment target. Who and what am I assessing. How secure do I think my network is before I conduct an assesment,  How many devices are connected on this network, what are these devices used for, who are the stakeholders in this scenario? what are the overall risk and potential security meassures that may need to be implemented on this network. 

The risk managment assessment was conducted was on my home network. Within the preperation phase I was able to conclude that the scope of my networks security was relatvily unkown becasue there was no risk assesments done prior to this. The next thing I was able to confrim was the number of devices running on my network with an NMAP scan on my network which came out to be___ . The stakeholders for this include the people who use this network which would be my family and I. My perdiction for the overall security of the network was that is was secure. 



<br />



 ## Categorize:  <br/> 

<br /> When categorizing the security of the network you have questions like what is the worst that can happen on the network? How could the stakeholders be affected by a breach in the network. What is the confidentiallity of data that is on that network? The way I would categorize the networks security would be with the CIA triad. The implementation of Confidentiallty, Integrity, and Avaliblity. The Confidentialltiy of the networks secruity would be labled as High because this is a private network. There is a lot of personal and private data on each and everyone of  those does devices. The integrity level of the network would be labeled as low since this is a private network and not public so the chances of data being tampered with our changed would be realtivily low. The avalblity level of this network would be labled as moderate.Its not like this is a public web server where there would be a high need for avalblity. I labled it's avalblity as moderate becuase it is a small private network connection that is used on a day to day basis for simple uses of IOT devices. Another way you can categorize the risk for the networks secruity is with a risk assessment matrix. This calculates the liklyhood of that security issue happening and the servity/ damage it can cost. This is then multiplied and you would get your risk score.



<br />



## Select:  <br/>

<br /> The select phase is where we are looking at our safgaurds and are choossing our NIST controls that we would want to be implmented on in the assessment. I refrenced NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5. The control that was selected was the Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning  RA-5. This insures that a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported;. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations; Formatting checklists and test procedures; and . Measuring vulnerability impact, Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring, Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities Assignment: organization-defined response times in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk, Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems and
 ,Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.  




## Implemention 
<br/> The implementation phase of the risk assessment is taking the controls/safgaurds that you have selected and making sure that they are implemented correctly. During this phase you will make sure that each control that has been selected has an assinged person that will be responsible for that specefic control. This ensures that all the controls are implemented. So in this scenario we would have someone who takes cares each control that has been placed. This would include the RA-5 control from the NIST SP 800-53 revision 5.

1.Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and        reported

2. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
  
3. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations
   
4.  Formatting checklists and test procedures

5. Measuring vulnerability impact

6. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring
   
7. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities Assignment: organization-defined response times in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk
   
8. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems
   
9. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.

This is the stage where all roles and responsbilties will be assingned and documented, documentation of new software/equipment that might be needed to start implemention of these new controls, and even potential staffing changes if this assesment was done in a real life company enviornment.   


## Assess: 

<b> The Assessment phase is where we have already begun the implmentation of our controls for the assessment. In this phase we analylze and monitor how the controls we have implemented are working in our the assessed subject. In this scenario  I could run another network scan with Nessus and see if I get the same vulnerblites or new vulnrblites insuring that the device on that network is secure. I could also run vulnerblites scans on diffrent tools such as Armitage or Metasploit to see if any of the same vulnerblites and exploits would occur. During this stage the assessors conducting the assessment phase of the risk management framework would be reviewing all documentation of the Vulnerblitly scans that were conducted on the network and would use this to. To insure proper assessment stages automation is particularlly advise due to the exaughsting efforts of monitoring and reoporting for systems. <b> </br> 

## Authorize 

<b> 
For the authorization stage of this assessment, this is where a senior level advisor gets invovled. A senior level adviosr would then do an evaluation of the assessed subject.  In this scenario this is  the security of the network that was tested. After completion of the evaluatoion by the senior offical. If all controls that are set are deemed applicable and approved by the senior offical then it will then be sigined off and athorized. This is all completed by the senior offical by revewing the 
SAP(System Authorization Package) which includes the SSP (System Security Plan) and the SAR (Security Assesment Report).


## Monitor 

<b> The last step of the security risk assessment is to continue to monitor the controls that are implmented on the network for its security. This can include installing updates on devices specifically security updates and patches to installing new hardware that may be needed to be replaced when its life span has run its course.    </b>

This is a simple home lab project where I tested my  network for security vulnerblites and remediated them.

<br />





<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>



- <b> Nessus </b> 

- <b> Mac OS

-  Mac OS Terminal </b>



<h2>Environments Used </h2>



- <b> Mac OS  </b>

<br /> As shown in the Nessus  windows, you can see two things. In the first window you can see the scan type I performed on the network which was a basic network scan. And in the second window are a list of  all my scanned devices on my network with the vulnerblites . In total it was 6  devices scanned  but to make my analysis easier I removed the devices that showed no security Vulnerblites which left me with one device on the network with security issues. 

<br />



## Vulnerblites ON MAC OS for Microsoft Office Applications :  <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/OYGxEbm.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

<br />       

In this window you can see the vulnerblites that are listed for the  Microsoft Office applications. There are  multiple security issues that left these microsoft office applications vunerable to attacks such as remote code execution on Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft outlook. Some more vulnerblites include Microsoft excel security bypass vulnerblity, Microsoft word elevation privilage vunerblity and  Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability. After going through each vulnerblity listed I was able to conclude that the the Microsoft office applications should be updated to each current latest version which contains the security patches for word, Excel,power point and outlook. After disccovering this I downloaded updated versisons for each application. 

<br />



 ## Vulnerblites ON MAC OS for Apache web server:  <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/KUGsINV.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

<br /> The vulnerability that is shown in this window pertains to the Apache web server installed on the Mac os. As you can see in the first window all the  possible vulnerabilities are listed. To remediate this I downloaded an updated version of the apache web server via terminal.This is shown in the second window. As you can see in the second window. After I installed the latest version I used the httpd -v command to see the version that is currently running on the Mac os. It was still the old version 2.4.56. I then retarted the Mac system for the updated web server to show and when I checked again and it showed the most up to date version. Apache 2.4.58 which is the recommended version from nessus that has the security paches for these vulnerblites. 



<br />



## Vulnerblites On Mac OS:  <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/qes9XMK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

<br /> 

The specfic vulnerblites listed for the Mac OS are all potential attacks that can be executed towards the system. The way to remediate these vulnerblites would be a simple system update. The current version of Mac OS that is running on the system is 14.0 the update recommended by nessus is the Mac OS of 14.1.2 which contains security patches for the vulnerblites listed for 14.0. I later installed latest running OS for Mac.

<br />



## Vulnerblites On Mac OS for Zoom client application <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/IgPLdqf.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>



<br /> The last vulnerblity that was found on the Mac OS was with the application zoom. The vulneriblites found by nessues include  Improper authorization in some Zoom clients may allow an authorized user to conduct an escalation of privilege via network access,Insufficient control flow management in some Zoom clients may allow an authenticated user to conduct an information disclosure via network access,Buffer overflow in some Zoom clients may allow an unauthenticated user to conduct a denial of service via network access,Improper conditions check in Zoom Team Chat for Zoom clients may allow an authenticated user to conduct a denial of service via network access and aCryptographic issues with In-Meeting Chat for soZoom clients may allow a privileged user to conduct an information disclosure via network access. These are all vulnerblites that are found with the current version of zoom found on this system 5.15.12. Nessus recommends downloading version 15.16.0 that contains the vulnerblity pataches for this application. After finding these vulnerblites on the Mac os system I downloaded the latest version of zoom client application.  

<br />



## CIA TRIAD FRAMEWORK  :  <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/DIfJXge.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

<br /> The vulnerblity assesment that I conducted on my network is a very important task that companies all around the world need to implemnt to insure their information/data security. Cyber secuirty frameworks such as the CIA Traid help us insure proper security. As I have done, the vulnerblity assesment that I conducted on my network made sure to implement this framework. Confidentiality is very big when it comes to securing your data. With the assesment that I did on my network I was able to discover vulnerblites with certain applications that leak data. Integrity is the next objective in the CIA Triad. The importance of this is to make sure that the information that an application is providing has the correct security measures so that data is not tampered with and is 100 percent authentic and can be trusted. There were also vulnerblites of this too found on my network. The last objective the CIA Triad covered on the network vulnerblity assement is avalblity. With the vulnerblity report that nessus provided some applications had vulnerblites of a dos(denial of service) attack. In conclusion the CIA TRIAD was correctly implemented in all of these applications due to updates that I installed for each api. The security vulnerblites were all mitigated for these applications which insured confidentiality, Integrity, and avalblity lity for each api on the device.

<h2>NIST INCIDENT CYCLE</h2>



 

 - <b> PREPERATION: In preperation for this lab I had to download and configure the vunlnerblity scaning tool nessus. After doing so I confirmed what my test network would be which would end up being my personally home network. I also had some set targets that I expected would pose potential security issues due to lack of updates. So I made sure to write them on a list and conrfirm that they come up on my nessus vulnerblity scan. </b>

  

- <b> DETECTION/ANALYSIS: The detection portion of this lab was all done through nessus. After I got the IP address of one of the devices on my home network. I specifed the range I wanted to scan. This range scanned all IP address for all possible devices that are connected on my network. After the network scan was completed nessus report gave me vulnerblites that I need to remideate to insure the overall saftety of my device. </b>



- <b> CONTAINMENT ERADECATION AND RECORVERY: The steps taken for containment,eradecation and recovery all depend on orginizations methods and policys. But generally speaking for a network vulnerblity test the priority would be taking care vulnerblites given on your report. You would want to prioritze your critical vulnerblites first and work your way down to high,medium and then Low. After determing the vulerblites on your devices you would want to install updates for each api or on your system depending on the report that nessus has given to you. </b>

- <b> POST INCIDENT ACTIVITY: In this example sceniario we were tasked at scanning a network and testing it for vulnerblites. After the report for the vulnerblites from the test . We implemented remedeation technqiues to reslove these vulnerblites. Which in this case was intalling updates that contain the most up to date security patches for these api's. One example of post incident activtiy that would msot likley be taking place after a test like this would be anaylzing a companies policy for the security of devcies. Depending on vulnerblites found and how long it took to remediate these vulnerblites, a company could change it polcies. It could range from the type of network scans that should be done , how frequenty a security network scan should be done, is there a need to do individual scans on devices and many other suggestions depending on the result of the scan. Overall the post incident activity is a way to learn and reflect to insure better protective security measures for the company. </b>
